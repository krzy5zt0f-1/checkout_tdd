# Test Driving Multiple Objects

The code created for this exercise is an implementation for a supermarket checkout to scan items. It has been based on the following user stories:
```
As a shopper
So I know how much an item costs
I would like to be able to see its price
```
```
As a shopper
So that I can buy an item
I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout
```
```
As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items
```
```
As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (Â£xx.xx)
```
My main focus here was to follow a rigorous TDD process: RED, GREEN, REFACTOR!
